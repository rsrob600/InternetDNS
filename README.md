# InternetDNS
I've taken some liberties on this project to improve the UIX as listed below:

1 - added a left navigation menu
2 - added a footer with navigation links
3 - moved the office hours and contact info up to the whiespace header so it is more prominent on the page (harder to see against the darker grey page section header with the DNS title)
